These are some of the projects I’ve worked on in my spare time.

## The Markdown Resume

Maintaining a resume is one of those annoying tasks that always takes up much more time than it should. Compounding this is the fact that resumes are regularly requested in different formats: raw text, pdf, Microsoft Word, etc. In addition, it might be desirable to have a HTML version online somewhere for added visibility. How then to manage this complexity? No one wants to manually update four versions of their resume, and the pdf conversion tools included with word processors leave much to be desired.
